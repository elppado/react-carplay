# React-Carplay

## FORKED FROM 
`https://github.com/rhysmorgan134/react-carplay/`


## What I Did

Removed unnecessary parts, made slight optimizations, and fixed some bugs.

1. Restored keyboard functionality.
2. Made the Siri button usable (via the keyboard).
3. Removed all tabs and changed the background color.
4. Modified everything to suit my preferences.
